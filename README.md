# Cryptocurrencies website payment method

This is a Python script to accept cryptocurrencies payment for website owner.

The program is very simple, It basically allow the website owner to creates DEPOSIT wallets for USERS or CLIENTS, and save them into a DATABASE.

It works with all the coins that use a BITCOIN core clone wallet client. The code published is based on CLAM coin.

I'm going to add new codes to this repository, to manage transactions to hot wallet, and to allow withdrawals to USERS or CLIENTS EXTERNAL WALLETS.

You need a local wallet installed an sync on your computer or on the server.
It uses subprocess library to call, and execture che -cli WALLET CONSOLE commands.
